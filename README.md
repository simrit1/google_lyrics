# google_lyrics
a alternative to lyr that get lyrics for you using google 


I don't want to explain how it works again so just looks at the comments in the code they are very good 


# to use 
import glyrics
glyrics.song('as it was').lyrics

it will return None if lyrics can't be retrived

# limitations 

currently it only works about 85% of the time however the more popular the song the more likely that it will be able to retrive them 
and *adding the songs artist will increase chances it is found*
